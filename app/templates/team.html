                <p>
                    PubliScore was developed as part of a hackathon project focused on creating tools to improve
                    urban mobility and accessibility in Antwerp. Our goal was to create a simple yet effective
                    way to evaluate locations based on their public transport connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using open data from OpenStreetMap, we developed an algorithm that can provide an accessibility
                    score for any location in Antwerp, helping residents make more informed housing decisions that
                    support sustainable transportation choices.
